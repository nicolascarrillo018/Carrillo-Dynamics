Carrillo Dynamics | Infrastructure Diagnostic System
Operational Status: STABLE

Core Objective: Bridging the gap between field operations and office administration via engineered synchronization.

// Project Overview
This repository contains the high-performance, mobile-responsive web infrastructure for Carrillo Dynamics. The system is designed to identify operational friction in industrial logistics and provide a streamlined entry point for infrastructure auditing.

// System Architecture
The project is built on a "Terminal-Minimalist" logic, prioritizing high-yield information density and zero software fluff.

index.html: The command center. Establishes the mission and core value proposition.

audit.html: The diagnostic console. A data-collection engine integrated with Google Forms for real-time operational profiling.

cases.html: The results archive. A technical log of proven deployments and reclaimed capacity.

thank-you.html: Transmission confirmation and automated system reset.

// Technical Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (using custom CSS variables for brand DNA).

Typography: Inter (San-Serif) & JetBrains Mono (Technical/Mono).

Logic: Native JavaScript for countdown timers and form state management.

Grid: Custom 50px synchronized CSS grid background across all modules.

// Asset Inventory
favicon.ico: Standard browser tab identification.

CD-logo.png: High-resolution (512x512) master asset.

apple-touch-icon: Hard-linked asset for mobile home-screen persistence.

// Deployment Notes
The system is configured for root-level deployment. Any changes to the file directory structure require updated pathing in the <nav> components and the mobile-link headers.

// Maintenance
For updates to the friction profile parameters, edit the Google Form entry IDs located in the diagnostic-form section of audit.html.
